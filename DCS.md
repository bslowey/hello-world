# GitHub Satellite 2021
## _Digital Customer Support (DCS) shares their journey on empowering developers across the globe with digital experiences to self solve!_
San Francisco, California. – August, 2021 - At Satellite, the DCS team showcased support experiences that allow developers around the globe to self serve. This means more developers have been able to get the answers they need, when they need them, the first time they tried! The experiences they have enabled, combined with the expertise of their fellow  Support Hubbers, has resulted in an average  60% Problem Resolution Rate (PRR) rating this year and an increase in online Self-Help Success (SHS) rate by 30 percentage points in one year!!! 

“Our goal is to empower our customers with the support they need when they need it. Sometimes customers prefer great self-help, sometimes they need a Support Engineer, either way, we make that easy for them. Most importantly, we learn from every single support interaction, to improve our product when possible and the experience we offer our customers. I'm so proud of what the team has done! ” - states Nat Friedman, CEO, GitHub.

Whenever a GitHub customer needs help, they can log into the support portal and search for relevant self-help content. If needed, they can create a ticket  and in that process, they will see relevant support content powered by machine learning (ML), this gives them targeted self-help that is relevant to their issue. Depending on the customer issue, the self-help might be a docs article, a pinned community thread, or powerful automation delivered via a Virtual Support Agent (VSA). With the latest ML translation technology, they have enabled their VSA in 12 languages within a year! Through the whole experience it’s always easy for a customer to get access to “human” support if they choose.

“Our team has relied on GitHub to allow us to build and deliver great software! What gives us extra confidence in GitHub is the level of support they offer. Like any software, sometimes things can go wrong…. We feel empowered with the knowledge we need through their excellent self-help experiences, like their support content and community, but we also know we have access to world class 24x7 support with a rapid response time when it's needed. What was really cool this year is our team in South America has been able to engage with their VSA 24x7 in Spanish or Portguese! That level of support gives me a lot of trust in GitHub'' – said Jay Sreedharan Senior VP, Software Engineering, MGM Resorts.

The GitHub Community is a showcase for any industry on what a thriving community should be. Developers can come and ask questions in a number of languages and in most cases their problem will be solved by another Developer. The community is also powered by some of GitHub’s best Support Engineers who are there to help when others can’t. Often they are the face of GitHub support, sharing their expertise in industry events and conferences. The power from their community is derived from the 1:many support. Once an answer is in place, it's pinned to the relevant thread and the next customer with that question can easily find that answer via Google (any search engine?)  or from the support portal.
 
“GitHub is literally my livelihood, it enables me to do the job I love doing and get paid for it via GitHub sponsors. Their support community is an extension of the product for me, I love to spend time there helping other devs, I get such satisfaction from it. Recently I got added to their rising star program for my contributions in the community and recognized in GitHub Satellite by Nat, how amazing is that!” – states Abidemi Lawhead a Full Stack Developer in Nigeria 
  

**Frequently Asked Questions –**
 
- 1 Why did GitHub put such a focus on Digital Support?
GitHub support believed the majority of customers try self-serve before contacting assisted support. Especially Devs- they like to fix problems! A paper from Gartner ‘delivering on the digital promise’, showed them that 61% of the customers surveyed tried self-service before ending up with an engineer. They looked at that as every one of those customers had a Customer Experience (CX) failure, by not providing them with a clear self-service option. That’s what they went after!










What strategy did GitHub put in place to enable this level of support?
GitHub support starts with the customer and keeps the customer center in everything they do. To enable this, they built a Customer Experience Framework (CXF) with the customer at the center.

Their framework is focused on three areas; firstly, empowering customers through self-serve that allows them to prevent and resolve issues, they call this Empower. Secondly, having world class support available quickly when the customer needs their expertise, they call this Help. Finally, being able to advise their customer how to get more from their products, they call this Advise. Surrounding the framework to bring it to life is their world class support Hubbers! 
 
How did they execute on the strategy for Digital Customer Support?
With the CXF in place they built a team whose primary function was empowering their customers to self-serve. The team started by putting six tenets in place for DCS, these were the guiding principles they always came back to in any experience they drove.
 
Give customers choice - We won't “force” a customer through a specific self-help asset. We will give them options and let the customer choose what is best for them, with the path to assisted support always clear and easy for entitled customers.
Know the customer - don't ask them what we already know. We will use applicable data to help drive a better digital experience. 
Design connected experiences - at a scenario level, we will build support journeys that highlight to the customer the best way to solve their issue, for example linking into Docs articles from Help Hub when we know we have a great article or a pinned post in the community.
Automation to make it easy - we will take the need to do manual steps away from a customer if they choose, by leveraging technology such as Power Virtual Agent (PVA).
Developers helping Developers - we will enable a thriving Community, leveraging the knowledge of our best developers to help other developers.
“Slick hand-off” to Support Hubbers - when digital doesn't work, the customer is passed to a Support Hubber via a seamless transfer with context. The Support Hubber will know what the issue was and the digital steps the customer already tried.
 
How did they measure the success of their digital support?
The customer is at the center of everything GitHub support does and with that, there are  two KPIs that they focused on for DCS -

Problem Resolution Rate (PRR) - Survey Question: Did we solve your problem? Yes/No. This question exists in areas like their Docs articles, Community posts and the VSA. It tells them the most important thing directly from the customer, did they fix the issue!
Self Help Success (SHS) - is a measure used when a customer comes into a digital support asset that offers a path to potentially create an assisted support request, performs some functions to get self-help support, and does not open up an assisted support request within 72 hrs. Example, a customer is in the Contact us flow on the Support Hub, creating a ticket, they see relevant self-help, they follow that help and no longer go ahead with creating the ticket.
Formula = # of solved workflows (based on customer did not open a ticket within 72 hrs) / # of Self-help workflows. 
 
How did they build a thriving community?
A key pillar of their digital strategy was enabling a thriving community with developers helping developers. In the past their support community was very much 1:1 support with most of the answers coming from Support Hubbers. To build a thriving community with developers helping developers, they built a simple “flywheel” and got it spinning!! Below is a view of their initial flywheel concept.

Traffic – Every community needs people. A thriving community is full of people who care. The more developers who care about GitHub we can bring to our community, the faster the wheel will spin as we increase the “traffic”.
Issues Resolved - the more developers we have in the community, the more we will see issue resolution happen from the community versus Support Hubbers.
Top Contributors Program - we will recognize the developers who help the most through a loyalty program with annual awards for the top contributors recognized by Nat.
Increase Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - the more posts we can “pin” with resolution steps, the more SEO will increase, as Google will drive traffic there when customers search for a specific issue.    
Stars Program - we will encourage our Stars to contribute to the community,with tips and tricks in videos and  blogs.



How was the team made up?
The DCS team is made up of people that are truly customer obsessed, every decision they make starts with the customer and ends with the customer. They are risk takers, constantly trying to innovate to create a better experience for their customers. They are not afraid to make mistakes, to them, that means they are pushing the boundaries for their customers and learning.

The DCS team consisted of two Functions, Support Operations and the Community team with the following roles.
 
Support Operations –
Supportability Program Managers (SPM) – Accountable for working with Engineering Product and Design (EPD) to drive down Incident Per X (IPX) for their products/features.  They accomplish this by working with EPD to eliminate an issue and/or by working with the software engineers to implement self-help experiences to increase SHS or PRR.
Voice of the Customer & Voice of Support PM – Accountable for the processes to capture and action feedback from our customers and our support team. They use this feedback from our customers and stakeholders to drive supportability recommendations and operational improvements (training, documentation, tooling, workflows, etc.) 
Software Engineers – Accountable for creating digital customer experiences that empower our customers to self-serve their issues.  They accomplish this through the evaluation, development and integration of digital support tools including HelpHub, Enterprise Support Bundle (ESB) tools, Virtual Support Agent and chatops. 

 
 
Community Team -
Support Engineers – Accountable for increasing PRR in the community for the products or areas they are aligned to. They accomplish this via responding to public topics (tickets), and creating model answers for highly viewed and trending questions appearing in both public and private support areas. 
Community Managers – Accountable for the structure and safety of the community. They accomplish this by moderation, flagging and removing dangerous or harassing posts, and moving posts between categories. Also accountable for content management, ensuring technical and account questions are answered in a timely manner,  and gathering metrics for analysis. Also responsible for support via Twitter, which consists of answering user questions publicly pertaining to GitHub products, private support tickets, and outage incidents.
Community Program Managers – Accountable for driving success of the community via analysis of metrics, gathering information for Business Reviews, engaging with users and assisting them as they move through trust levels, identifying gaps in processes and providing recommendations to fill them. The Program Managers are also responsible for driving programs to improve the overall community experience. For example, connecting the Rising Stars program with GitHub Stars, improving the gamification (badging) process and increasing the percentage of topics handled by community users vs. Hubbers.

 
How did the team innovate on digital support experiences?
GitHub support is full of talented people with brilliant ideas. The DCS team made sure ideas came from everywhere in the support org to help improve the customers digital experience. Through their Voice of Support program, they created a process that allowed anyone from support to raise an idea to improve the digital support experience, others could chime in on that idea and then each month they would take forward the best ideas into their planning cycles.

If you were to stop a DCS Support Hubber in an elevator and ask them a simple question, why are you here, what would they say?
Easy! Empowering developers with digital experiences to self solve!
